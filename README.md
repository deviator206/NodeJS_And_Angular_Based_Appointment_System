# NodeJS_And_Angular_Based_Appointment_System
Trying to create application wiht [ angular js - nodejs-mysql ]


THis is intended for self-learning... [FOR ME!!]

will be trying to complete this application with few days.
Will be using basic packages available in nodejs
[mysql,http,path]

Started building the app ..
steps
 - install node 
 - install my-sql
 
 begin with basic coding 
 var http = require("http")
  //createServer.... listenTo()...
  //imported mysql then tried using it
  
FIRST PROBLEM: how to run HTML.JS files from node server .
  
  I was under impression, that node was similar to apache/iis  - on which we deploy the web application , which can be accessed 
  using localhost...
  But node was different tried searching for many options got the following it worked for me.. 
  Thanks a lot for this blogger.... ERIC
